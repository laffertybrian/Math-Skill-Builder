# Math-Skill-Builder
Simple math game to build fluency, turned machine learning project.

This game began as a way for my children to increase their fluency in math. As I was creating the program I realized that recording the data from each game could become a wonderful dataset to work with. Using this data to build a machine learning model that could predict if the user was going to answer a given question correctly. I have built machine learning models before, but never for use in real time.

Beyond the machine learning aspect of this program I want it to be very useful for my children. I am trying to create features that will make this game easier to use and be able to target certain aspects of learning the four main mathematical operations. Adding features such as number of rounds, difficulty of problems, customize number ranges, focus on certain numbers for improvment, and being able to save all of these settings has been a fun coding challenge.

Current progress:
I am making adjustments to the testing mode. This has given me an idea to rewrite some portions of the game. I hope that these adjustments will make sense to the over all program and clean up the implenmentaion of the testing mode into the program. The testing mode is critical to the random gathering of information needed in the dataset that will be used to create a machine learning model.
