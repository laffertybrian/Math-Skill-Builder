# Math-Skill-Builder
Simple math game to build fluency, turned machine learning project.

This game began as a way for my children to increase their fluency in math. As I was creating the program I realized that recording the data from each game could become a wonderful dataset to work with. Using this data to build a machine learning model that could predict if the user was going to answer a given question correctly. I have built machine learning models before, but never for use in real time.

Beyond the machine learning aspect of this program I want it to be very useful for my children. I am trying to create features that will make this game easier to use and be able to target certain aspects of learning the four main mathematical operations. Features like, number of rounds, focus areas, and being able to save and reuse the setting you selected during the prior use.
